## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0)
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixabay_gallery.git
    cd pixabay_gallery
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the application (Development)**

    ```bash
    # Use Flutter development server (handles CORS automatically)
    flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3000 --web-hostname=localhost

    # Or use the provided script
    ./run-dev.sh
    ```

4. **Run the application (Chrome)**

    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```

5. **Build for production**

    ```bash
    flutter build web --release
    ```

## 🔧 Development Notes

### CORS Issues

When developing locally, use the Flutter development server instead of serving static files:

```bash
# ✅ Correct - Use Flutter development server
flutter run -d web-server --web-port=3000

# ❌ Avoid - Static file serving causes CORS issues
python -m http.server 8000
```

The Flutter development server automatically handles CORS and provides hot reload functionality.
